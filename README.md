<li> First, you need to go into the browser window and enter "intellij idea download" into the search bar.
     Only in English. </li>
<li> We choose the version of "Community", since it is completely free of charge and it implements everything we need</li>
<li> While the IDE is downloading, we need to download the JDK. Enter into the search bar "jdk download"</li>
<li> We get into the masonry download, where we choose the version of Java SE.
     When choosing, we must start from the bit system.</li>
<li> We also need to download the latest version of the Firefox browser. What again leads us to google and search for "download firefox"</li>
<li> After we downloaded everything, we ran the setup files one by one. We begin with the installation of IDE Intellij.</li>
<li> During the installation, we agree to all that the program asks for us, sell the soul, apartment, heart ....</li>
<li> After installing the IDE, we proceed to install the JDK, there as well agree to everything they want.</li>
<li> Then quickly install the firefox browser and proceed to start the IDE</li>
<li> After starting the IDE, we select the Maven item</li>
<li> We connect JDK, click next and give the name to our project. Also, do not forget to look at the project, so that you do not have to search for it all over the computer.</li>
<li> Next, the program will launch the window of our project where we can prescribe our fine code. In perspective.</li>
